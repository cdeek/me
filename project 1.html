<p>Magnus Carlsen is a Norwegian chess grandmaster who is the reigning five-time World
Chess Champion. He is also a three-time World Rapid Chess Champion and five-time World
Blitz Chess Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1
July 2011, and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest rated player in the world.
His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record for the longest
unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess.</p>
<p>A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament
shortly after he turned 13, and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At 15, he
won the Norwegian Chess Championship, and at 17, finished joint first in the top group of
Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at 18, the youngest at the time to do so. In 2010, at 19,
he reached No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings, the youngest person ever to do so.</p>
<p>Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He
retained his title against Anand the following year, and won both the 2014 World Rapid
Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles
simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019. He defended his classical world title against
Sergey Karjakin in 2016, against Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and against Ian Nepomniachtchi in
2021. Carlsen does not intend to defend his title against Nepomniachtchi in 2023.</p>
<p>Known for his attacking style as a teen, Carlsen has since developed into a universal
player. He uses a variety of openings to make it harder for opponents to prepare against him
and reduce the utility of pre-game computer analysis. He has stated the middlegame is his
favourite part of the game as it "comes down to pure chess".</p>
<h3>Chess career of Magnu Carlsen</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2004</strong>Carlsen made headlines after his victory, at the age of 13,
in the C group at the 2004 Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee. He obtained a score of
10½/13, losing just one game (against the highest-rated player of the C group, Duško
Pavasovič). As a result, he earned his first GM norm, and achieved a PR of 2702. Particularly
notable was his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round, when he sacrificed material to
give mate in just 29 moves. His victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in
2005, and it led Lubomir Kavalek, writing for the Washington Post, to give him the title "the
Mozart of chess" (although, as pointed out by Edward Winter, the nickname had been given to
many illustrious predecessors). Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory and
played an unusually wide range of openings. Carlsen's prowess caught the attention of
Microsoft, which became his sponsor.</li><br>
<li><strong>2005</strong>In the Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen
International Chess Festival 2004–05, Carlsen defeated Alexei Shirov, then ranked No. 10 in
the world, as well as the co-winner of the tournament. In the semifinals of the Ciudad de León
rapid chess tournament in June, Carlsen played a four-game match against Viswanathan
Anand, who was ranked No. 2 in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid
Chess Championship.</li><br>
<li><strong>2006</strong>Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his
first-place finish in Corus group C in 2004. His shared first place with Alexander Motylev with
9/13 (+6−1=6) qualified him to play in the Corus group A in 2007.</li><br>
<li><strong>2007</strong>Playing in the top group of the Corus chess tournament for
the first time, Carlsen placed last with nine draws and four losses, scoring 4½/13. In the
Linares chess tournament, Carlsen played against top-rated players Veselin Topalov,
Viswanathan Anand, Peter Svidler, Alexander Morozevich, Levon Aronian, Peter Leko, and
Vasyl Ivanchuk. Despite being rated significantly lower than any of them, he finished in second
place on tiebreaks with 7½/14, having scored four wins, seven draws and three losses, and
achieving a PR of 2778</li><br>
<li><strong>2008</strong>In the top group A of the 69th Corus chess tournament,
Carlsen scored 8/13, achieving a PR of 2830. Carlsen won five games, lost two and drew six,
sharing first place with Levon Aronian. At the Linares chess tournament, Carlsen had another
2800+ PR, scoring 8/14. He finished in sole second place, ½ point behind the winner World
Champion Viswanathan Anand.</li><br>
<li><strong>2010</strong>Carlsen won the 72nd Corus chess tournament played
16–31 January with 8½ points. His ninth-round loss to Kramnik ended a streak of 36 rated
games undefeated. Carlsen appeared to struggle in the last round against Fabiano Caruana,
but saved a draw, leaving him half a point ahead of Kramnik and Shirov.</li><br>
<li><strong>2012</strong>At the 74th Tata Steel Chess Tournament held on 14–29
January in Wijk aan Zee, Carlsen finished in a shared second place with 8/13, behind Aronian,
and equal with Radjabov and Caruana. Carlsen defeated Gashimov, Aronian, Gelfand, and
Topalov, but lost against Karjakin. At the blitz chess tournament at Tal Memorial, held in
Moscow on 7 June, Carlsen shared first place with Morozevich. In the main event (a category
22 ten-player round robin), he won two games and drew seven. He finished in first place, ahead
of Radjabov and Caruana.</li><br>
<li><strong>2016</strong>From 15 to 31 January, Carlsen participated in the 78th
Tata Steel Chess Tournament, held in Wijk Aan Zee. Carlsen won the tournament by scoring 9
points out of 13 (+5−0=8), earning him his 5th Wijk Aan Zee title.</li><br>
<li><strong>2019</strong>From 12 to 27 January, Carlsen competed in the 81st Tata
Steel Chess Tournament. With a score of 9/13 (+5−0=8),[211] half a point ahead of Giri, he won
the tournament for a record-extending seventh time.</li><br>
<li><strong>2022</strong>In January, Carlsen won his eighth Tata Steel Chess
Tournament. He finished with a score of 9½/13, with no losses and six wins, including wins
against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Fabiano Caruana.</li>
