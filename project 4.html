                <p>
                     Now
                    we consider that influence: Why does the motion of an object change? What might cause
                    one object to remain at rest and another object to accelerate? Why is it generally easier to
                    move a small object than a large object? The two main factors we need to consider are the
                    forces acting on an object and the mass of the object. In this chapter, we begin our study of
                    dynamics by discussing the three basic laws of motion, which deal with forces and masses
                    and were formulated more than three centuries ago by Isaac Newton.

            <article>
                <p>Everyone has a basic understanding of the concept of force from everyday experience. When you push your empty dinner plate away, you exert a force on it. Similarly, you exert a force on a ball when you throw or kick it. In these examples, the
                    word force refers to an interaction with an object by means of muscular activity and
                    some change in the object’s velocity. Forces do not always cause motion, however.
                    For example, when you are sitting, a gravitational force acts on your body and yet
                    you remain stationary. As a second example, you can push (in other words, exert a
                    force) on a large boulder and not be able to move it.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h5>The Vector Nature of Force</h5>
                <p>It is possible to use the deformation of a spring to measure force. Suppose a vertical force is applied to a spring scale that has a fixed upper end as shown in Figure  5.2a. The spring elongates when the force is applied, and a pointer on the
                    scale reads the extension of the spring. We can calibrate the spring by defining a
                    reference force F
                    S
                    1 as the force that produces a pointer reading of 1.00 cm. If we
                    now apply a different downward force F
                    S
                    2 whose magnitude is twice that of the reference force F
                    S
                    1 as seen in Figure 5.2b, the pointer moves to 2.00 cm. Figure 5.2c
                    shows that the combined effect of the two collinear forces is the sum of the effects
                    of the individual forces.
                    Now suppose the two forces are applied simultaneously with F
                    S
                    1 downward and
                    F
                    S
                    2 horizontal as illustrated in Figure 5.2d. In this case, the pointer reads 2.24 cm.
                    The single force F
                    S that would produce this same reading is the sum of the two vectors F
                    S
                    1 and F
                    S
                    2 as described in Figure 5.2d. That is, 0 F
                    S
                    1 0 5 !F1
                    2 1 F2
                    2 5 2.24 units, and its direction is u 5 tan21 (20.500) 5 226.6°. Because forces have been experimentally verified to behave as vectors, you must use the rules of vector addition to
                    obtain the net force on an object.</p>

                <header><h3>Newton’s First Law</h3></header>
                <p>We begin our study of forces by imagining some physical situations involving a puck
                    on a perfectly level air hockey table (Fig. 5.3). You expect that the puck will remain
                    stationary when it is placed gently at rest on the table. Now imagine your air hockey
                    table is located on a train moving with constant velocity along a perfectly smooth
                    track. If the puck is placed on the table, the puck again remains where it is placed.
                    If the train were to accelerate, however, the puck would start moving along the
                    table opposite the direction of the train’s acceleration, just as a set of papers on
                    your dashboard falls onto the floor of your car when you step on the accelerator.</p>

            mass is the kilogram. Experiments show that the greater the mass of an object, the
            
            <p>Imagine playing catch with either a basketball or a bowling ball. Which ball is more
                likely to keep moving when you try to catch it? Which ball requires more effort to
                throw it? The bowling ball requires more effort. In the language of physics, we say
                that the bowling ball is more resistant to changes in its velocity than the basketball.
                How can we quantify this concept?</p>
            <p>Mass is that property of an object that specifies how much resistance an object
                exhibits to changes in its velocity, and as we learned in Section 1.1, the SI unit of
                less that object accelerates under the action of a given applied force.
                To describe mass quantitatively, we conduct experiments in which we compare
                the accelerations a given force produces on different objects.</p>

        <section id="newton_second_law_of_motion">
            <h3>Newton’s Second Law</h3>
            <p>Newton’s first law explains what happens to an object when no forces act on it: it
                maintains its original motion; it either remains at rest or moves in a straight line
                with constant speed. Newton’s second law answers the question of what happens to
                an object when one or more forces act on it.
                Imagine performing an experiment in which you push a block of mass m across
                a frictionless, horizontal surface. When you exert some horizontal force F
                S on the
                block, it moves with some acceleration a
                S. If you apply a force twice as great on the
                same block, experimental results show that the acceleration of the block doubles; if
                you increase the applied force to 3 F
                S
                , the acceleration triples; and so on. From such
                observations, we conclude that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional
                to the force acting on it: F
                S ~ a
                S. This idea was first introduced in Section 2.4 when
                we discussed the direction of the acceleration of an object. We also know from the
                preceding section that the magnitude of the acceleration of an object is inversely
                proportional to its mass: 0 a
                S 0 ~ 1/m.</p>

        <section id="The_Gravitational_Force_and_Weight">
            <h3>The Gravitational Force and Weight</h3>
            <p>All objects are attracted to the Earth. The attractive force exerted by the Earth on
                an object is called the gravitational force F
                S
                g . This force is directed toward the center of the Earth,3 and its magnitude is called the weight of the object.
                We saw in Section 2.6 that a freely falling object experiences an acceleration g
                S
                acting toward the center of the Earth. Applying Newton’s second law g F
                S 5 ma
                S to
                a freely falling object of mass m, with a
                S 5 g
                S and g F
                S 5 F
                S
                g , gives
                F
                S
                g 5 mg
                S (5.5)
                Therefore, the weight of an object, being defined as the magnitude of F
                S
                g , is given by
                Fg = mg (5.6)
                Because it depends on g, weight varies with geographic location. Because g
                decreases with increasing distance from the center of the Earth, objects weigh less
                at higher altitudes than at sea level. For example, a 1 000-kg pallet of bricks used
                in the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City weighed 9 800 N
                at street level, but weighed about 1 N less by the time it was lifted from sidewalk
                level to the top of the building</p>

        <section id="Newton’s_Third_Law">
            <h3>Newton’s Third Law</h3>
            <p>If you press against a corner of this textbook with your fingertip, the book pushes
                back and makes a small dent in your skin. If you push harder, the book does the same
                and the dent in your skin is a little larger. This simple activity illustrates that forces
                are interactions between two objects: when your finger pushes on the book, the book
                pushes back on your finger. This important principle is known as Newton’s third law:
                If two objects interact, the force F
                S
                12 exerted by object 1 on object 2 is equal in
                magnitude and opposite in direction to the force F
                S
                21 exerted by object 2 on
                object 1:
                F
                S
                12 5 2 F
                S
                21 (5.7)
                Newton’s third law 
                5.6 Newton’s Third Law 119
                When it is important to designate forces as interactions between two objects, we
                will use this subscript notation, where F
                S
                ab means “the force exerted by a on b.” The
                third law is illustrated in Figure 5.5. The force that object 1 exerts on object 2 is
                popularly called the action force, and the force of object 2 on object 1 is called the
                reaction force. These italicized terms are not scientific terms; furthermore, either
                force can be labeled the action or reaction force. We will use these terms for convenience. In all cases, the action and reaction forces act on different objects and must
                be of the same type (gravitational, electrical, etc.). For example, the force acting
                on a freely falling projectile is the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on
                the projectile F
                S
                g 5 F
                S
                Ep (E 5 Earth, p 5 projectile), and the magnitude of this
                force is mg. The reaction to this force is the gravitational force exerted by the projectile on the Earth F
                S
                pE 5 2 F
                S
                Ep. The reaction force F
                S
                pE must accelerate the Earth
                toward the projectile just as the action force F
                S
                Ep accelerates the projectile toward
                the Earth. Because the Earth has such a large mass, however, its acceleration due
                to this reaction force is negligibly small.
                Consider a computer monitor at rest on a table as in Figure 5.6a. The gravitational force on the monitor is F
                S
                g 5 F
                S
                Em. The reaction to this force is the force
                F
                S
                mE 5 2 F
                S
                Em exerted by the monitor on the Earth. The monitor does not accelerate because it is held up by the table. The table exerts on the monitor an upward
                force n
                S 5 F
                S
                tm, called the normal force. (Normal in this context means perpendicular.) In general, whenever an object is in contact with a surface, the surface exerts
                a normal force on the object. The normal force on the monitor can have any value
                needed, up to the point of breaking the table. Because the monitor has zero acceleration, Newton’s second law applied to the monitor gives us g F
                S 5 n
                S 1 mg
                S 5 0,
                so n j
                ^ 2 mg j
                ^ 5 0, or n 5 mg. The normal force balances the gravitational force on
                the monitor, so the net force on the monitor is zero. The reaction force to n
                S is the
                force exerted by the monitor downward on the table, F
                S
                mt 5 2 F
                S
                tm 5 2n
                S.
                Notice that the forces acting on the monitor are F
                S
                g and n
                S as shown in Figure 5.6b.
                The two forces F
                S
                mE and F
                S
                mt are exerted on objects other than the monitor.
                Figure 5.6 illustrates an extremely important step in solving problems involving forces. Figure 5.6a shows many of the forces in the situation: those acting on
                the monitor, one acting on the table, and one acting on the Earth. Figure 5.6b,
                by contrast, shows only the forces acting on one object, the monitor, and is called
                a force diagram or a diagram showing the forces on the object. The important pictorial representation in Figure 5.6c is called a free-body diagram. In a free-body
                diagram, the particle model is used by representing the object as a dot and showing the forces that act on the object as being applied to the dot. When analyzing an object subject to forces, we are interested in the net force acting on one
                object, which we will model as a particle. Therefore, a free-body diagram helps
                us isolate only those forces on the object and eliminate the other forces from our
                analysis.</p>

            <h3>Analysis Models Using Newton’s Second Law</h3>
            <p>In this section, we discuss two analysis models for solving problems in which
                objects are either in equilibrium 1 a
                S 5 02 or accelerating under the action of constant external forces. Remember that when Newton’s laws are applied to an object,
                we are interested only in external forces that act on the object. If the objects are
                modeled as particles, we need not worry about rotational motion. For now, we also
                neglect the effects of friction in those problems involving motion, which is equivalent to stating that the surfaces are frictionless. (The friction force is discussed in
                Section 5.8.)
                We usually neglect the mass of any ropes, strings, or cables involved. In this
                approximation, the magnitude of the force exerted by any element of the rope on the
                adjacent element is the same for all elements along the rope. In problem statements,
                the synonymous terms light and of negligible mass are used to indicate that a mass is to
                be ignored when you work the problems. When a rope attached to an object is pulling on the object, the rope exerts a force on the object in a direction away from the
                object, parallel to the rope. The magnitude T of that force is called the tension in the
                rope. Because it is the magnitude of a vector quantity, tension is a scalar quantity.</p>
                <h5>Analysis Model: The Particle in Equilibrium</h5>
                <p>If the acceleration of an object modeled as a particle is zero, the object is treated with
                    the particle in equilibrium model. In this model, the net force on the object is zero:
                    a F
                    S 5 0 (5.8)
                    Consider a lamp suspended from a light chain fastened to the ceiling as in Figure
                    5.7a. The force diagram for the lamp (Fig. 5.7b) shows that the forces acting on the
                    5.7 Analysis Models Using Newton’s Second Law 121
                    lamp are the downward gravitational force F
                    S
                    g and the upward force T
                    S exerted by
                    the chain. Because there are no forces in the x direction, o Fx 5 0 provides no helpful information. The condition o Fy 5 0 gives
                    oFy 5 T 2 Fg 5 0 or T 5 Fg
                    Again, notice that T
                    S and F
                    S
                    g are not an action–reaction pair because they act on
                    the same object, the lamp. The reaction force to T
                    S is a downward force exerted by
                    the lamp on the chain.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p><strong>Newton’s first law</strong> states that it is possible to find an inertial frame in which
                an object that does not interact with other objects experiences zero acceleration,
                or, equivalently, in the absence of an external force, when viewed from an inertial frame, an object at rest remains at rest and an object in uniform motion in a
                straight line maintains that motion.<br>
                <strong>Newton’s second law</strong> states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
                <br><strong>Newton’s third law</strong> states that if two objects interact, the force exerted by object
                1 on object 2 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force
                exerted by object 2 on object 1</p>
